\title{Creates bit-level (clipping representation) from a vector}
\usage{
clipping(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the numeric vector (time series)}
}
\value{
the integer vector of zeros and ones
}
\description{
The \code{clipping} computes bit-level (clipping representation) from a vector.
}
\details{
Clipping transforms time series to bit-level representation.

It is defined as follows:
\eqn{repr_t = {1 if x_t > \mu , 0 otherwise}}, where \eqn{x_t} is a value of a time series
and \eqn{\mu} is average of a time series.
}
\examples{
clipping(rnorm(50))

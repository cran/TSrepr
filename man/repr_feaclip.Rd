\title{FeaClip representation of time series}
\usage{
repr_feaclip(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the numeric vector (time series)}
}
\value{
the numeric vector of length 8
}
\description{
The \code{repr_feaclip} computes representation of time series based on feature extraction from bit-level (clipping) representation.
}
\details{
FeaClip is method of time series representation based on feature extraction from run lengths (RLE) of bit-level (clipping) representation.
It extracts 8 key features from clipping representation.

There are as follows: \eqn{repr = {sum_1 - sum of run lengths of ones,
max_0 - max. from run lengths of zeros,
jumps - length of RLE encoding - 1,
0_{1.} - number of first zeros,
0_{n.} - number of last zeros,
1_{1.} - number of first ones,
1_{n.} - number of last ones}}.

repr_feaclip(rnorm(50))
